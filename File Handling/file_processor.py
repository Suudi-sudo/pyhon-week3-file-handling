This is a sample text file that you can use to test the file processor.

Here are some interesting facts:
- Python is great for file handling
- Error handling makes programs robust
- Files can contain various types of data

You can create your own files to test with different content types:
- Text files (.txt)
- Python files (.py)
- Markdown files (.md)
- And many more!

Happy coding!
